            <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p> Welcome to my Portfolio! My name is Diana Bingani, and I am a Third year Computer Science student. I have a strong interest in web development.
                beyond academics, I enjoy working on Projects that challenge me to think critically and apply my skills in creative ways.
                I am always eager to learn, collaborate, and grow in both technical and professional aspects.
            </p>

                I am currently working on a modern, responsive web page designed to showcase my skills 
                and experience in an engaging and interactive way.
                One of my key goals is to make the site not just a static portfolio but an interactive space where visitors can explore
                my work through project demos, blog posts, and even a coding playground.
